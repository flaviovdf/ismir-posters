Data is in `data/`. Here, we have datasets to reproduce most of\r\n      the results from the papers:\r\n      \r\n      [Mining Online Music Listening Trajectories](https://flaviovdf.github.io/papers/figueiredo2016-ismir-musictraj.pdf)\r\n      \r\n      and \r\n      \r\n      [Exploring the Latent Structure of Collaborations in Music Recordings: A Case Study in Jazz](https://flaviovdf.github.io/papers/andrade2016-jazz.pdf) \r\n      \r\n      The former is on the `poster-listening-trajs` folder, the later on the\r\n      `poster-jazz-trajs`.\r\n\r\n  1. Example code is on the `code` folder. This code can be used to answer\r\n     some common questions with TribeFlow and Swift-Flows. Please check\r\n     the [TribeFlow](https://flaviovdf.github.io/papers/figueiredo2016-www.pdf) \r\n     paper and code (http://github.com/flaviovdf/tribeflow), as well as the two \r\n     papers above for more details\r\n",
