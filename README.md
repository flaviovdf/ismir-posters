  1. Data is in `data/`. Here, we have datasets to reproduce most of
      the results from the papers:
      
      [Mining Online Music Listening Trajectories](https://flaviovdf.github.io/papers/figueiredo2016-ismir-musictraj.pdf)
      
      and 
      
      [Exploring the Latent Structure of Collaborations in Music Recordings: A Case Study in Jazz](https://flaviovdf.github.io/papers/figueiredo2016-www.pdf) 
      
      The former is on the `poster-listening-trajs` folder, the later on the
      `poster-jazz-trajs`.

  1. Example code is on the `code` folder. This code can be used to answer
     some common questions with TribeFlow and Swift-Flows. Please check
     the [TribeFlow](https://flaviovdf.github.io/papers/figueiredo2016-www.pdf) 
     paper and code (http://github.com/flaviovdf/tribeflow), as well as the two 
     papers above for more details
