  1. Data is in `data/`. Here, we have datasets to reproduce most of
      the results from the papers:
      
      [Mining Online Music Listening Trajectories](aaa)
      
      and 
      
      [Exploring the Latent Structure of Collaborations in Music Recordings:
      A Case Study in Jazz](bbb) 
      
      The former is on the `poster-listening-trajs` folder, the later on the
      `poster-jazz-trajs`.

  1. Example code is on the `code` folder. This code can be used to answer
     some common questions with TribeFlows and Swift-Flows. Please check
     the TribeFlow paper and code (http://github.com/flaviovdf/tribeflow) and
     paper, as well as the two papers above for more details
